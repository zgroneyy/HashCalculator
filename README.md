# File Hash Calculator

The File Hash Calculator is a simple Python application that allows you to select a file and calculate its SHA-256 hash. This ensures the integrity of the selected file and provides a hash value that can be used for various purposes, including verifying the file's authenticity.

## Features

- Select a file from your local system.
- Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the selected file.
- Display the hash value on the user interface.
- Copy the hash value to the clipboard for easy sharing and reference.

## Prerequisites

Before using the File Hash Calculator, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `pyperclip` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install pyperclip
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-hash-calculator.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd file-hash-calculator
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python file_hash_calculator.py
   ```

4. The application will open, and you can use it to select a file, calculate its hash, and copy the hash to the clipboard.

## Usage

1. Click the "Browse" button to select a file from your local system.
2. The full path to the selected file will be displayed in the input field.
3. Click the "Process Now" button to calculate the SHA-256 hash of the selected file.
